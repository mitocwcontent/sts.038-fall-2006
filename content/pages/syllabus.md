Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Overview
--------

This course uses the prism of energy to examine the history of the United States from the colonial period to the present. We will consider how energy has affected, and is affected by, American society, culture, science and technology, politics, diplomacy, and the environment. Major questions to keep in mind throughout the course include: how has increasing energy use has transformed American social life, the economy, and politics? What are the relationships between energy consumption and environmental change? What are the relationships between scientific discoveries, technological innovation, and social change? How did the United States grew to be the larger consumer of energy in the history of the world?

Class Structure
---------------

Class meets twice a week. The first session of the week consists of lectures, and the second session of class discussion of the week's readings.

Assignments
-----------

Students will write weekly, two-page response papers on the readings in advance of the week's discussion session (and to be handed in at the end of that discussion). This assignment is intended to facilitate critical thinking about the readings and your reactions will serve as prompts for our class discussions. **Note**: response papers are not due on the days your other, longer essays are due. In addition, you may drop the lowest graded response from your final grade calculation. See [assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments) for a more detailed description of how to approach them. Students have two options for longer writing assignments. Everyone will write a 5-8 page mid-term essay, due in class in Ses #13, which will address themes raised in the first half of the course.

### Writing Option One

Writing option one involves a second 5-8 page final essay, due in class in Ses #24, plus a final exam during the exam period.

### Writing Option Two

Writing option two recognizes that not everyone likes to take final exams. If you choose this option, you will instead write a single, 15-20 page research paper, due in class in Ses #26. If you choose this option, **you must let me know** by Ses #9 so we can discuss your topic and research strategy.

| REQUIREMENTS | PERCENTAGES |
